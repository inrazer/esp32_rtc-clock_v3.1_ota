At start up the ESP32 connect to the defined WLAN, next it syncs the internal RTC with a defined NTP server.
Until the sync is complete, the step-up for the +160V anode supply stays disabled.
If the RTC is synced, the anode supply is enabled and all nixie cathodes are cycled 2 times.

After start-up the diplay show actual time until all times end ... or power gets interrupted.
